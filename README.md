# Project-One_1
Project one is an air base. Governments have created aircraft in order to escape the virus. The secret base remains a mystery, it often spawns in the clouds. To get there: - an oxygen cylinder with its mask -warm clothes -a parachute -a helicopter - glasses that make the Zmb visible  a landing platform must be created so as not to trigger the Zmbs when you land you have time to prepare before the Zmbs attack successive waves of Zmb follow each other when a player loots a Zmb a count starts and makes the base disappear survivors will have to leave the aircraft before they fall into the void
